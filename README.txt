REQUIRED SOFTWARE:
1. MySQL
2. Python 2.7
3. MySQLdb for Python

To use the MySQL from Python, please make sure the you have started the MySQL server. For example, on a Mac, the command is “mysql.server start”.

PLEASE ENTER YOUR MYSQL INFORMATION INTO LINE 5 OF main.py! This is how we connect to MySQL.

Running main.py should work from there.

PLEASE NOTE: When creating and deleting tables, “GROUP” appears as a syntax error. As is such, we have changed the name of the table to “GROUPS”
